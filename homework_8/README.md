Homework Tasks: Arrays with Simple Types (C#)

1. Find the Maximum Number:
   - Create an int[] array of 10 numbers.
   - Use a loop to find and display the maximum number.
2. Reverse an Array:
   - Take a string array (e.g., names of 5 students).
   - Print the array in reverse order.
3. Calculate the Average:
   - Store exam scores in a double[].
   - Calculate and print the average score.
4. Count Even and Odd Numbers:
   - Create an int[] with 10 numbers.
   - Count how many are even and how many are odd.
5. Search for an Element:
   - Create a string[] of fruits.
   - Ask the user to enter a fruit name and search the array.
   - Print whether it was found or not.
6. Sort an Array (Manually):
   - Write a simple sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) to sort an int[] in ascending order.
7. Sum of Array Elements:
   - Create an int[] with predefined values.
   - Use a loop to calculate the total sum.
8. Copy Elements to Another Array:
   - Create an array of 5 integers.
   - Copy its contents into another array using a loop.
9. Concatenate Two String Arrays:
   - Have two string[] arrays (e.g., first names and last names).
   - Combine each pair into full names and print the result.
10. Frequency Count:
    - Create an array with repeated integers (e.g., {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}).
    - Count and print how many times each number appears
